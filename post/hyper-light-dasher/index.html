exception of <a href=http://www.zachtronics.com/>Zachtronics</a> games on my
Linux machine). Lately I've been playing
<a href=https://heartmachine.com/hyper-light>Hyper Light Drifter</a>, a gorgeous
retro-styled action adventure game that its creator calls a mix of 2D
Zelda and Diablo. The game is challenging, but plays nearly perfectly.
Exceptâ€¦</p><p>There is one optional challenge which calls for you to dash 800 times
consecutively in a confined space. This requires you to button mash with
precise timing while directing the character in a circle to avoid
bumping into any walls. It's brutal, and
<a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/hyperlightdrifter/>discussion spaces</a> related to
the game are filled with stories and complaints about this challenge.</p><p>After many failed attempts and probably tens of thousands of button
mashes later, I decided there was probably a better way. On the PC
version, many players have decided to simply cheese the game by abusing
the keyboard controls or even using a program to automate the entire
feat. Doing this on the Switch is a bit trickier, though.</p><p>Luckily I remembered encountering
<a href=https://medium.com/@bertrandom/automating-zelda-3b37127e24c8>this
blog post</a> in which Bertrand Fan managed to write a program to win
rupees in Zelda for him. Building on the earlier work of
<a href=https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering>dekuNukem</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick>Jason DeLeon</a> to
reverse engineer parts of the Nintendo Switch, an inexpensive
<a href=https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html>USB development board</a> can
be made to emulate a Switch-compatible controller. With that hard work
out of the way, programming it to emit pre-determined sequences of
button presses is relatively simple.</p><p>Making the minimal necessary number of changes to the code, I was able
to adapt Bertrand's Zelda script to complete the dash challenge for me.
The <a href=https://github.com/ajgrf/hyper-light-dasher>resulting code</a> is
pretty ugly (there's no good reason why dashing 800 times should require
800 lines of code), but considering it's only meant to be run once I
have no reason to improve it.</p><p>Getting the timing right was the trickiest part. Bertrand uses a little
DSL to sequence his button presses that looks like this:</p><div class="src src-c"><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span class=k>typedef</span> <span class=k>struct</span> <span class=p>{</span>
    <span class=n>Buttons_t</span> <span class=n>button</span><span class=p>;</span>
    <span class=n>uint16_t</span> <span class=n>duration</span><span class=p>;</span>
<span class=p>}</span> <span class=n>command</span><span class=p>;</span>

<span class=k>static</span> <span class=k>const</span> <span class=n>command</span> <span class=n>step</span><span class=p>[]</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>{</span>
    <span class=p>{</span> <span class=n>B</span><span class=p>,</span>         <span class=mi>5</span> <span class=p>},</span>
    <span class=p>{</span> <span class=n>NOTHING</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>150</span> <span class=p>},</span>
<span class=p>};</span></code></pre></div></div><p>This will be interpreted as instructions to emit the B button for 5
units, followed by a pause for 150 units. But what are the units of
duration? It turns out that they're simply the number of times the main
loop should repeatedly report the same input to the console. Since the
USB polling frequency is 8 ms, and each USB report is echoed 3 times
(for reasons I don't really understand), then 5 units of duration is
approximately equal to 5 * 8 * 3 == 120 ms. Similarly, 150
units is 150 * 8 * 3 == 3600 ms, or about 3.6 seconds.</p></div><div id=postamble class=status><footer><div class=container>&copy; 2020 Alex Griffin. Unless otherwise noted, licensed under the
